# RGB
A Matlab GUI project 

This matlab application has created to see how RGB color combination works 

>To run on Matlab environment you should run [*instal_RGB.m*](https://github.com/DarshanaUOP/RGB/blob/master/install_RGB.m) file

>I have created two exe files

- [*Download Windows Executable file 1*](https://github.com/DarshanaUOP/RGB/blob/master/RGB/src/RGB.exe) and its [*readme.txt*](https://github.com/DarshanaUOP/RGB/blob/master/RGB/src/readme.txt)
- [*Download Windows Executable file 1*](https://github.com/DarshanaUOP/RGB/blob/master/Untitled2/src/Untitled2.exe) and its [*readme.txt*](https://github.com/DarshanaUOP/RGB/blob/master/Untitled2/src/readme.txt)

**The main UI**  <br>
<img src = "images/RGB UI.JPG" widtg = 100%> 

This main UI shows that there are 3 slidebars and you can change them and make various color mixtures such as following figure <br>
<img src = "images/RGB UI 2.JPG" height = 250> <br>
then background of your Application will change according to the color mixture you have generated by changing slidebars.
